Focus: C# Programming Practice – Operators, Data Types, Typecasting, and Problem Solving

What I did today:

Implemented C# programs for:
Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, unary, ternary, and is operators
Implicit and explicit typecasting
User input-based programs solving real-world problems:
Age calculation
Average marks calculation
Distance conversion (km to miles)
Profit & loss calculation
Height conversion (cm to feet & inches)
Basic calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Triangle area calculation
Square side from perimeter
Distance conversion (feet to yards & miles)
Total purchase price
Maximum handshakes calculation
Quotient and remainder
Integer operations (operator precedence)
Double operations (operator precedence)
Temperature conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa)
Total income calculation
Swapping two numbers
Travel computation with user input
Athlete’s triangular track rounds
Chocolate distribution
Simple interest calculation
Weight conversion (pounds to kg)
What I learned:

Confidently handling user input and performing computations dynamically
Using typecasting (implicit & explicit) in C#
Applying operator precedence correctly in complex expressions
Building structured programs for a variety of practical problems
Reinforced understanding of C# syntax, variable types, and operators
